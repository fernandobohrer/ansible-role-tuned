# tuned_profile: throughput-performance
#
# Optional 'tuned_profile' variable. Only required if you want to manually set
# the tuned profile. The above translates to running the command below on the
# target Linux boxes: tuned-adm profile throughput-performance
#
# To get a list of the available profiles, after installing tuned, you can run:
# tuned-adm list
#
# When the optional tuned_profile variable is not set, tuned figures out the
# recommended profile and applies it to the system using the command below:
# tuned-adm profile $(tuned-adm recommend)
