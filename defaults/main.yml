# Update the apt cache if it is older than the apt_cache_valid_time value.
# Option set in seconds.
apt_cache_valid_time: 3600

# tuned__profile: throughput-performance
#
# Optional tuned__profile variable. Only required if you want to manually set the tuned
# profile. The above translates to running the command below on the target Linux boxes:
# tuned-adm profile throughput-performance
#
# To get a list of the available profiles, you can run: tuned-adm list
#
# When the optional tuned__profile variable is not set, tuned figures out the
# recommended profile itself and applies it to the system using the command below:
# tuned-adm profile $(tuned-adm recommend)
